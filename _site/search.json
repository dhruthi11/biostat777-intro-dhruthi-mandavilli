Production and Sale Emissions are lower then Cradle to Production Emissions for most or all commodities, with a positive correlation between the emissions of the two stages. Manufacturing is a huge source of emissions with Culture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting, as well as Transportation and Warehousing being second and third highest in emissions. Public Administration and Management of Companies and Enterprises are the lowest in total emissions. These results can be used to determine which US commodities and production sectors need to be targetting for reducing emissions (manufacturing) through research and policy. It would be interesting to look into what sorts of research has been done using this dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFunctions Used:\n\ndplyr:\n\nrename\narrange\ndesc\nselect\nslice_head\nslice_tail\nfull_join\nfilter\n\ntidyr:\n\npivot_longer\n\nggplot:\n\ngeom_histogram\ngeom_point\ngeom_smooth\ngeom_bar"

    "text": "I am a first-year ScM Biostatistics student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I did my undergraduate at UC Berkeley in environmental science and public health. I am passionate about solving environmental health and climate health issues through a biostatistical lens and also hope to do work in carceral health. I prioritize working with communities to tailor my research to local needs. My short-term goals are to pursue a PhD in environmental health after my master’s, and my long-term goals are in academia training future climate health researchers and developing my aforementioned research. I believe that two of the most important aspects of creating a safe future for humanity are achieving health equity and accessibility for better quality of life, as well as alleviating climate change for a sustainable way of life.\nI have done research in the Wang, Schell, and Ruhi labs at UC Berkeley on Aegean wall lizards, San Francisco gentrification’s impact on bird populations, and invertebrates in intermittent streams. I also interned with the CalEPA Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to develop accessible two-pagers on the impacts of climate change and create environmental health lesson plans for 3rd - 5th graders in the Bay Area. At UC Berkeley, I was also the co-president of the Environmental Health Alliance and on the board of Herbicide-Free Berkeley. Currently, I am working with the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative in Baltimore to bridge the gap between the Inflation Reduction Act and local access to solar energy.\nFor fun I like to do jigsaw puzzles, paint, go on hikes, bake, and spend time with my friends. I was born in North Carolina and grew up in Eugene, Oregon.\nPublications Throat color polymorphism is related to differences in aggression in the Aegean wall lizard: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.14.585063v1"
