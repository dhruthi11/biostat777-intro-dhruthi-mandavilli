	abstract = {The datasets comprise greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors (Factors) for 1,016 U.S. commodities as defined by the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset.},

	title = {Bar charts — geom\_bar},
	url = {https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html},
	abstract = {There are two types of bar charts: geom\_bar() and geom\_col().
geom\_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of
cases in each group (or if the weight aesthetic is supplied, the sum
of the weights). If you want the heights of the bars to represent values
in the data, use geom\_col() instead. geom\_bar() uses stat\_count() by
default: it counts the number of cases at each x position. geom\_col()
uses stat\_identity(): it leaves the data as is.},
