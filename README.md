# biostat777-intro-dhruthi-mandavilli

My name is Dhruthi Mandavilli, and I am a first-year ScM Biostatistics student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I completed my BS in Environmental Science and BA in Public Health at UC Berkeley. 

I am passionate about solving climate health and environmental health issues through a biostatistical lens and also hope to do work in carceral health while prioritizing working with local communities.
